\chapter{Recurrent Neural Networks for Object Classification}\label{sec:renet}

\emph{Classification} is a broad task that consists in predicting to which
category an input belongs to, out of some $k$ given categories. The system is
usually required to compute a function $f: \RR^d \to {0, \dots, (k-1)}$ that
assigns each input to a class. This can be thought as a discrimination task,
where the algorithm is expected to learn similarities and differences between
categories in order to characterize each class.

Some examples of classification are spam detection (classify a message as being
spam or not), credit card fraud detection (identify if a transaction is legit
or not), Optical Character Recognition (OCR) (convert hand-written text to an
electronic document, by classifying each character), speech understanding
(given an utterance from a user, detect the sentence that was pronounced),
medical diagnosis (given the symptoms predict the illness and suggest a cure),
stock trading (determine if a stock should be bought, held or sold, from
current and historical data), shape detection (classify a hand-drawn drawing
from, e.g., a touch screen, as a specific shape) and sentiment analysis (given
a text, classify it as being positive, neutral or negative)

\emph{Object recognition} is an instance of this task that takes an image as an
input and is expected to return the id of the main class represented in the
image. This is usually achieved by computing the probability distribution over
the classes -- i.e.\ the confidence of the algorithm for each class to be the
main class in the scene -- and then picking the one with highest score.

One downside of this method is that small and big mistakes are penalized the
same, i.e., the prediction is considered wrong whether the right class is the
second most probable class in the distribution or is considered extremely
unlikely by the algorithm. For this reason, some competitions such as
e.g.,~ImageNet~\citep{imagenet_cvpr09, ILSVRCarxiv14}, propose multiple
challenges where the top-3 or top-5 guesses are considered, i.e., where an
image is considered correctly predicted if the correct class is in the top
$3$ or $5$ guesses of the network.

Traditionally the computer vision community used to address this task with
heavily hand-engineered systems that typically resorted to finding easily
detectable elements in the image -- such as e.g.\ edges or corners -- and
computing a descriptor of the surrounding patch. Many detectors~\citep{
dufournaud2000matching,harris1988combined,mikolajczyk2001indexing,
lowe2004distinctive,mikolajczyk2005performance} and descriptors~\citep{
lowe1999object,mikolajczyk2005performance,belongie2002shape} have been proposed
to this end, until in 2012 a deep convolutional neural network markedly shifted
the balance towards learned ANNs~\citep{Krizhevsky-2012}. Since then CNN-based
models dominated the object recognition scene.

This chapter presents ReNet, one of the main contributions of this thesis.
The ReNet model is a deep neural network architecture for object recognition,
based on recurrent neural networks. The main idea behind this project is to
propose an alternative to the typical CNN-based approach to object
classification problems. The ReNet model replaces in fact the ubiquitous
convolution+pooling layers of deep CNNs with four recurrent neural networks
that sweep horizontally and vertically in both directions across the image.

The following sections motivate the model in the context of the state of the
art at the time it was conceived, describe the ReNet model in detail and
present the results of its evaluation on three widely-used object recognition
benchmarks, namely  MNIST~\citep{Lecun99objectrecognition},
CIFAR-10~\citep{KrizhevskyHinton2009} and SVHN~\citep{Netzer-wkshp-2011}. The
experiments reveal that the ReNet model performs comparably to convolutional
neural networks on all these datasets, suggesting the potential of RNNs as a
competitive alternative to the conventional deep convolutional neural networks
for image related tasks.


\section{Motivation}

Convolutional neural networks~\cite[CNN,][]{Fukushima80,LeCun89} have become
the method of choice for object recognition after the impressive improvement on
the state of the art of~\cite{Krizhevsky-2012}. CNNs have proved to be
successful at a variety of benchmark problems including, but not limited to,
handwritten digit recognition~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Ciresan-2012}, natural image
classification~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Lin2014,Simonyan2015,szegedy2014going},
house number recognition~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Goodfellow+et+al-ICLR2014a},
traffic sign recognition~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Ciresan-et-al-2012}, as well as
for speech recognition~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Hamid2012, sainath2013,
toth2014combining}.  Furthermore, image representations from CNNs trained to
recognize objects on a large set of more than one million
images~\citep{Simonyan2015,szegedy2014going} have been found to be extremely
helpful in performing other computer vision tasks such as image caption
generation~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Vinyals-et-al-arxiv2014,Xu-et-al-arxiv2015},
video description generation~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Li2015} and object
localization/detection~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Sermanet14}.

While the CNN has been especially successful in computer vision, recurrent
neural networks (RNN) have become the method of choice for modeling sequential
data, such as text and sound. Natural language processing (NLP) applications
include language modeling~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Mikolov-thesis-2012}, and
machine translation~\citep{Sutskever-et-al-NIPS2014,Cho2014,
bahdanau2014neural}. Other popular areas of application include offline
handwriting recognition/generation~\citep{Graves+Schmidhuber-2009,
Graves-et-al-NIPS2007,Graves-arxiv2013} and speech recognition~\citep{
Chorowski-et-al-arxiv2014,Graves+Jaitly-ICML2014}. RNNs have also been used
together with CNNs in speech recognition~\citep{sainath2015}. The recent
revival of RNNs has largely been due to advances in learning
algorithms~\citep{Pascanu+al-ICML2013-small,Martens+Sutskever-ICML2011} and
model architectures~\citep{Pascanu-et-al-ICLR2014,Cho2014}.

The architecture of ReNet is related and inspired by this earlier work, but
relies on purely uni-dimensional RNNs coupled in a novel way, rather than on a
multi-dimensional RNN. The basic idea behind the ReNet model is to replace each
convolutional layer (with convolution+pooling making up a layer) in the CNN
with four RNNs (i.e., two bidirectional RNNs) that sweep over lower-layer
features in different directions: (1) bottom to top, (2) top to bottom, (3)
left to right and (4) right to left.  The recurrent layer ensures that each
feature activation in its output is an activation at the specific location
\emph{with respect to the whole image}, in contrast to the usual
convolution+pooling layer which only has a local context window. The lowest
layer of the model sweeps over the input image, with subsequent layers
operating on extracted representations from the layer below, forming a
hierarchical representation of the input.

\citet{Graves+Schmidhuber-2009} have demonstrated an RNN-based object
recognition system for offline Arabic handwriting recognition. The main
difference between ReNet and the model of \citet{Graves+Schmidhuber-2009} is
that it uses the usual sequence RNN, instead of the multidimensional RNN. The
way ReNet has been conceived allows in fact to capture the context of the
image without being forced to resort to multidimensional RNNs: the latter two
RNNs (or, equivalently, the last bidirectional RNN), work on the hidden states
computed by the first two RNNs (or the first bidirectional RNN). This allows
to use plain RNNs instead of the more complex multidimensional ones, while
making each output activation of the layer be computed with respect to the
whole input image.

One important consequence of the proposed approach compared to the
multidimensional RNN is that the number of RNNs at each layer scales linearly
with respect to the number of dimensions $d$ of the input image ($2d$). A
multidimensional RNN, on the other hand, requires an exponential number of RNNs
at each layer ($2^d$). Furthermore, the proposed variant is more easily
parallelizable, as each RNN is dependent only along a horizontal or vertical
sequence of patches. This architectural distinction results in the ReNet model
being much more amenable to distributed computing than that
of~\citet{Graves+Schmidhuber-2009}.


\section{Model Description}\label{sec:renet_model}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/renet/renet_first_layer.pdf}
    \caption{A ReNet layer. The green and blue dots on the input image/feature
        map represent the steps of $f^\uparrow$ and $f^\downarrow$
        respectively. On the concatenation of the resulting feature maps, the
        two RNNs $f^\rightarrow$ (yellow dots) and $f^\leftarrow$ (red dots)
        are subsequently swept. The output of the feature maps are finally
        concatenated to form the output of the ReNet layer, depicted as a blue
        heatmap in the figure.}
    \label{fig:renet_layer}
    \vspace{-3mm}
\end{figure}

Let us denote by $\mathbf{X}=\left\{x_{i,j}\right\}$ the input image or the
feature map from the layer below, where $\mathbf{X} \in \RR^{w \times h \times
c}$ with $w$, $h$ and $c$ the width, height and number of channels, or the
feature dimensionality, respectively. Given a receptive field (or patch) size
of $w_p \times h_p$, the image $\mathbf{X}$ is split into a set of $I \times J$
(non-overlapping) patches $P = \left\{ \mathbf{p}_{i,j} \right\}$, where $I =
\frac{w}{w_p}$, $J = \frac{h}{h_p}$ and $\mathbf{p}_{i,j} \in \RR^{w_p \times
h_p \times c}$ is the $(i,j)$-th patch of the input image. The first index $i$
is the horizontal index and the other index $j$ is the vertical index.

First, the image is swept vertically with two RNNs, with one RNN working in a
bottom-up direction and the other working in a top-down direction.  Each RNN
takes as an input one (flattened) patch at a time and updates its hidden state
$c^*$ (in the usual way, depending on the RNN implementation), working
\emph{along each column} $j$ of the split input image $\mathbf{X}$ to produce
two output vectors $o^{\uparrow}$ and $o^{\downarrow}$ defined as follows
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{o}^{\uparrow}_{i,j} = f^\uparrow(\mathbf{c}^{\uparrow}_{
        i,j-1},\mathbf{p}_{i,j}), &\text{ for }j=1,\cdots, J,\\
    \mathbf{o}^{\downarrow}_{i,j} = f^\downarrow(\mathbf{c}^{\downarrow}_{
        i,j+1},\mathbf{p}_{i,j}), &\text{ for }j=J,\cdots,1.
\end{align}

Note that the functions $f^\uparrow$ and $f^\downarrow$ return the
activation of the recurrent hidden unit, and may be implemented either as a
simple $\tanh$ layer, as a gated recurrent layer~\citep{Cho2014} or as a long
short-term memory layer~\citep{Hochreiter+Schmidhuber-1997}, as detailed
in~\autoref{sec:rnn}, \autoref{sec:LSTM} and \autoref{sec:GRU}).

After this vertical, bidirectional sweep, the intermediate hidden states
$\mathbf{o}^{\uparrow}_{i,j}$ and $\mathbf{o}^{\downarrow}_{i,j}$ are
concatenated at each location $(i,j)$ to get a composite feature map
$\mathbf{O}^\updownarrow=~\left\{\mathbf{o}_{i,j}^{\uparrow},~\mathbf{o}_{i,j}^
{\downarrow}\right\}_{i=1,\ldots,I}^{j=1,\ldots,J}$, where each element
$\mathbf{o}^\updownarrow_{i,j} \in \RR^{2d}$ and $d$ is the number of recurrent
units. Each $\mathbf{o}_{i,j}$ is now the activation of a feature detector at
the location $(i,j)$ with respect to all the patches in the $j$-th column of
the original input ($\mathbf{p}_{i, j}$ for all $i$).

Next, the obtained composite feature map $\mathbf{O}^\updownarrow$ is swept
horizontally with two different RNNs ($f^{\rightarrow}$ and $f^{\leftarrow}$).
In a similar manner as for the vertical sweep, these RNNs work along each row
of $\mathbf{O}^\updownarrow$ and produce an output feature map
$\mathbf{O}^\leftrightarrow = \left\{\mathbf{o}^\leftrightarrow_{i,j}
\right\}$, where $\mathbf{o}^\leftrightarrow_{i,j} \in \RR^{2d}$. In this
representation, each vector $\mathbf{o}^\leftrightarrow_{i,j}$ represents the
features of the original image patch $\mathbf{p}_{i,j}$ \emph{in the context of
the whole image}.

This is a critical feature of this model, in fact just one layer (to be
precise, two sub-layers) allows to capture the full context of the image,
irrespective of the image size. This is possible thanks to the (potential)
ability of RNNs to store in their memory any information that is relevant to
retain the context of the part of the image that has been processed. The first
two RNNs capture the horizontal dependencies in both directions. By reading
their composite feature map, the second pair of RNNs has access in each
position to a "summary" of the corresponding row. This is processed vertically,
to capture the missing dependencies between rows. This intra- and inter-row
processing results in a final composite feature map where each position is
specific to a pixel (or patch) of the image but has information on the full
image. Conversely, to span over the whole image with CNN-based architectures
would require many more layers, whose number depend on the size of the input
image.

Even if each ReNet layer captures the full input context, it is clearly still
possible to stack multiple ReNet layers on top of each other into a deep
network. Let us denote by $\phi$ the function from the input image (or feature
map) $\mathbf{X}$ of one ReNet layer to the output feature map
$\mathbf{O}^\leftrightarrow$ (see~\autoref{fig:renet_layer} for a graphical
illustration). It is possible to compute a composition of functions $\Phi =
\phi_1(\phi_2(\phi_3(\dots)))$ by stacking multiple ReNet layers, to capture
increasingly complex features of the input image.  After any number of
recurrent layers are applied to an input image, the activation at the last
recurrent layer may be flattened and fed into a differentiable classifier to
solve an object recognition task. The experiments on this model, presented
in~\autoref{sec:renet_experiments}, used several fully-connected layers
followed by a softmax classifier, as shown in~\autoref{fig:renet_network}.

The deep ReNet is a smooth, continuous function, and the parameters (those from
the RNNs as well as from the fully-connected layers) can be estimated by the
stochastic gradient descent algorithm with the gradient computed by
backpropagation algorithm described in~\autoref{sec:backprop} to maximize the
log-likelihood.

\subsection{Differences between LeNet and ReNet}\label{sec:lenetrenet}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/renet/lenet5.jpg}
    \caption{The LeNet network.}
    \label{fig:lenet}
    \vspace{-3mm}
\end{figure}

This section will use LeNet (see~\autoref{fig:lenet}) to refer to the canonical
convolutional neural network as shown by \citet{LeCun89}. There are many
similarities and differences between the ReNet model and a convolutional neural
network. The main key points of comparison will be highlighted in what follows.

At each layer, both networks apply the same set of filters to patches of the
input image or of the feature map from the layer below. ReNet, however,
propagates information through lateral connections that span across the whole
image, while LeNet exploits local information only. The lateral connections
should help extract a more compact feature representation of the input image at
each layer, which can be accomplished by the lateral connections
removing/resolving redundant features at different locations of the image. This
should allow ReNet resolve small displacements of features across multiple
consecutive patches. Also, the lack of this type of lateral connection in LeNet
may lead to many more levels of convolution+pooling layers in order to detect
redundant features from different parts of the image.

LeNet max-pools the activations of each filter over a small region to achieve
local translation invariance. In contrast, the proposed ReNet does not use any
pooling due to the existence of learned lateral connections. The lateral
connection in ReNet can emulate the local competition among features induced by
the max-pooling in LeNet.  This does not mean that it is not possible to use
max-pooling in ReNet. The use of max-pooling in the ReNet could be helpful in
reducing the dimensionality of the feature map, resulting in lower computational
cost.

Max-pooling as used in LeNet may prove problematic when building a
convolutional autoencoder whose decoder is an inverse\footnote{%
    All the forward arrows from the input to the output in the original LeNet
    are reversed.
}
of LeNet, as the max operator is not invertible. The proposed
ReNet is end-to-end smooth and differentiable, making it more suited to be used
as a decoder in the autoencoder or any of its probabilistic
variants~\citep[see e.g.,][]{Kingma+Welling-ICLR2014}.

In some sense, each layer of the ReNet can be considered as a variant of a
usual convolution+pooling layer, where pooling is replaced with lateral
connections, and convolution is done without any overlap. Similarly,
\citet{Springenberg2014} recently proposed a variant of a usual LeNet which
does not use any pooling.  They used convolution with a larger stride to
compensate for the lack of dimensionality reduction by pooling at each layer.
However, this approach still differs from the proposed ReNet in the sense that
each feature activation at a layer is only with respect to a subset of the
pixels of the input image rather than the whole input image.

The main disadvantage of ReNet is that it is not easily parallelizable, due to
the sequential nature of the recurrent neural network. LeNet, on the
other hand, is highly parallelizable due to the independence of computing
activations at each layer. The introduction of sequential, lateral connections,
however, may result in more efficient parametrization, requiring a smaller
number of parameters with overall fewer computations, although this needs to be
further explored. Note that this limitation on parallelization applies only to
model parallelism, and any technique for data parallelism may be used for both
the proposed ReNet and the LeNet.


\section{Experiments}\label{sec:renet_experiments}

\subsection{Datasets}

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/renet/mnist_digits.png}
    \caption{Some digits from the MNIST dataset.}
    \label{fig:mnist_digits}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/renet/cifar-10.png}
    \caption{Some samples of the 10 classes of the CIFAR-10 dataset.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/renet/SVHN.png}
    \caption{Some samples of housing numbers from the SVHN dataset.}
    \label{fig:svhn}
\end{figure}

The ReNet model has been evaluated on three widely-used benchmark datasets;
MNIST, CIFAR-10 and the Street View Housing Numbers (SVHN). This section
describes each dataset in detail.

\subsubsection{MNIST}
The MNIST dataset~\citep{Lecun99objectrecognition} consists of 70,000
handwritten digits from 0 to 9, centered on a $28\times 28$ square
canvas~(see~\autoref{fig:mnist_digits} for some samples). Each pixel represents
the grayscale in the range of $\left[0, 255\right]$.\footnote{Each pixel has
been scaled to $[0, 1]$ by dividing it with $255$.} It is customary to split
this dataset into 50,000 training samples, 10,000 validation samples and 10,000
test samples. For a fair comparison, the results reported
in~\autoref{sec:renet_results} were obtained following the standard split.

\subsubsection{CIFAR-10}
The CIFAR-10 dataset~\citep{KrizhevskyHinton2009} is a curated subset of the 80
million tiny images dataset~(see~\autoref{fig:cifar} for some samples),
originally released by \citet{Torralba+Fergus+Freeman-2008}. CIFAR-10 contains
60,000 images each of which belongs to one of ten categories: airplane,
automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. Each image is 32
pixels wide and 32 pixels high with 3 color channels (red, green and blue.)
Following the standard procedure, in the reported experiments the dataset
was split into 40,000 training, 10,000 validation and 10,000 test samples.
Furthermore, zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) was applied and each pixel
was normalized to have zero-mean and unit-variance across the training samples,
as suggested by \citet{KrizhevskyHinton2009}.

\subsubsection{Street View House Numbers}
The Street View House Numbers dataset~\citep{Netzer-wkshp-2011} consists
of cropped images representing house numbers captured by Google StreetView
vehicles as a part of the Google Maps mapping process. These images consist of
digits 0 through 9 with values in the range of [0, 255] in each of 3
red-green-blue color channels~(see~\autoref{fig:svhn} for some samples). Each
image is 32 pixels wide and 32 pixels high giving a sample dimensionality (32,
32, 3). The number of samples used for the training, validation, and test sets
is 543,949, 60,439, and 26,032 respectively. Each pixel was normalized to have
zero-mean and unit-variance across the training samples.

\subsection{Data Augmentation}

It has been long known that augmenting training data often leads to better
generalization~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Krizhevsky-2012}. Many of the reported
SOTA results were obtained using a mix of these techniques, for example
\citep{Goodfellow2013} reports a $1.52\%$ improvement on CIFAR10 by adding
translation and reflections; \citep{DBLP:conf/icdar/SimardSP03} uses elastic
distortion on MNIST; \citep{DBLP:conf/icml/WanZZLF13} applies cropping,
flipping, scaling, rotating on SVHN and CIFAR10. The results reported
in~\autoref{sec:renet_results} were all obtained employing two primary data
augmentations: {\it flipping} and {\it shifting}.

For the flipping data augmentation, the model was presented with samples that
were either flipped horizontally with 25\% chance, or vertically with 25\%
chance, or left unchanged. This technique allows the model to observe ``mirror
images'' of the original images of the dataset during training, increasing the
amount of training data. On SVHN and MNIST only horizontal flipping was used
to prevent the case were an image labelled $6$ is flipped in both direction,
becoming a $9$.

In the case of shifting two policies were adopted. The images were either
shifted by 2 pixels to the left (25\% chance), 2 pixels to the right (25\%
chance) or left as they were. After this first processing, the images were
further shifted either by 2 pixels to the top (25\% chance), 2 pixels to the
bottom (25\% chance) or left as they were. This two-step procedure makes the
model more robust to slight shifting of an object in the image. The shifting
was done without pre-padding the borders of the image, but rather preserving
the original size by dropping the pixels which are shifted out of the input
and shifting in zeros on the opposite side.

Exploiting data augmentation techniques with the ReNet model led to a $16\%$
improvement in test performance on MNIST and to less pronounced gains on the
other datasets. The choice of whether to apply these augmentation procedures on
each dataset was chosen on a per-case basis in order to maximize validation
performance.

    \caption{The ReNet network used for SVHN classification.}
    \label{fig:renet_network}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Experimental settings}

The principal parameters that define the architecture of the ReNet model are
the number of ReNet layers ($N_{\text{RE}}$), their corresponding receptive
field sizes ($w_p \times h_p$) and feature dimensionality ($d_{\text{RE}}$),
the number of fully-connected layers ($N_{\text{FC}}$) and their corresponding
numbers ($d_{\text{FC}}$) and types ($f_{\text{FC}}$) of hidden units.

Table~\ref{tbl:renet_architectures} summarizes the settings of these
hyperparameters that performed best on the validation set of the studied
datasets. \autoref{fig:renet_network} is a graphical illustration of the model
selected with this metric for the SVHN dataset.

    \caption{Model architectures used in the experiments. Each row shows
             respectively the number of ReNet layers, the size of the patches,
             the number of neurons of each ReNet layer, the number of fully
             connected layers, the number of neurons of the fully connected
             layers, their activation function and the data augmentation
             procedure employed.}
    \label{tbl:renet_architectures}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Training}
All the networks have been trained using a recently proposed adaptive learning
rate algorithm, called Adam~\citep{Kingma2014}. In order to reduce overfitting
dropout~\citep{Srivastava14} was applied after each layer, including both the
ReNet layers (after the horizontal and vertical sweeps) and the fully-connected
layers. The input layer was also corrupted by masking out each pixel with
probability $0.2$. Finally, each optimization run was early stopped based
on validation error.

Note that the results reported in~\autoref{sec:renet_results} were obtained
without retraining on the joint training and validation sets. This is a common
technique exploited by many works in the literature to boost the performance
of the best model, selected after a full training on the training set and early
stopping on the validation performance. There is no reason not to think that
this would further improve the reported results, but this work was mainly
conceived as a proof of concept rather than to stress on the absolute
performance. This, as well as e.g., ensembling multiple models, can be seen as
one of the many potential areas of exploration for further work in case maximum
performance is sought.

\subsection{Results}\label{sec:renet_results}

Table~\ref{tbl:renet_result}, presents the results of ReNet on three datasets,
along with previously reported results.

It is clear that ReNet performs comparably to deep convolutional neural
networks which are the {\it de facto} standard for object recognition. This
suggests that ReNet is a viable alternative to convolutional neural networks
(CNN), even on tasks where CNNs have historically dominated.  However, it is
important to notice that ReNet does not outperform state-of-the-art
convolutional neural networks on any of the three benchmark datasets, which
calls for more research in the future.


\section{Discussion}

The ReNet model successfully proved that RNN-based model can and should be
explored also in contexts where traditional CNN-based model have established
the state of the art for a long time, such as object recognition. Many aspects
of RNN-based models applied to this context remain to be studied in more depth,
some of which will be outlined in the rest of this section.

\subsubsection{Choice of recurrent units}
Note that the proposed architecture is independent of the chosen recurrent
units. The preliminary experiments on this model showed that gated recurrent
units, either the GRU or the LSTM, outperform a usual sigmoidal unit (affine
transformation followed by an element-wise sigmoid function.) This indirectly
confirms that the model utilizes long-term dependencies across an input image,
and the gated recurrent units help capture these dependencies.

\subsubsection{Choice of the topology}
A similar but less effective architecture would have been to flatten the matrix
of patches into a vector and process them with a singular bidirectional RNN
from the top-left patch to the bottom-right one. This alternative presents two
shortcomings: first, the network would have had to learn the dependency between
vertically adjacent pixels implicitly -- a much harder task than capturing the
dependency between pixels explicitly close in the input provided to the layer;
second, after a successful training, the network would have implicitly learned
the size of its input (i.e., that every $J$ patches are correlated), thus
constraining the trained model to work at inference time on images of the exact
same resolution.

\subsubsection{Analysis of the trained ReNet}
The ReNet model has been only evaluated in a quantitative fashion. However, the
accuracies on the test sets do not reveal what kind of image structures the
ReNet has captured in order to perform object recognition. Due to the large
differences between ReNet and LeNet discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:lenetrenet}, it
can be expected that the internal behavior of ReNet will differ from that of
LeNet significantly. Further investigation along the line of
\citep{ZeilerFergus14} is needed, as well as exploring ensembles that combine
RNNs and CNNs for bagged prediction.

\subsubsection{Computationally Efficient Implementation}
As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:lenetrenet}, the proposed ReNet is less
parallelizable due to the sequential nature of the recurrent neural network
(RNN). Although this sequential nature cannot be addressed directly, our
construction of ReNet allows the forward and backward RNNs to be run
independently from each other, which allows for parallel computation.
Furthermore, it is possible to exploit the many parallelization tricks widely
used for training convolutional neural networks such as parallelizing
fully-connected layers ~\citep{krizhevsky2014one}, having separate sets of
kernels/features in different processors~\citep{Krizhevsky-2012} and exploiting
data parallelism.
