\chapter{Convolutional RNNs for Video Semantic Segmentation}\label{sec:video_segmentation}

The previous chapter introduced the task of semantic segmentation, where the
model is requested to produce a semantic mask, i.e. to classify every pixel of
an input image. Rather than presenting the algorithm with a single image, a
variant of the segmentation task called cosegmentation, provides it with
multiple images usually taken at different locations in the same scene
(potentially by different cameras). In this setting the model can exploit the
information that the images potentially share to improve the single image
prediction and consequently improve the global score at the same time.

In many ways, \emph{video segmentation} can be seen as an extreme version of
cosegmentation, where the model is asked to segment multiple frames of a video.
As opposed to cosegmentation, where the images depict the same scene from
different angles and in moments potentially very far away in time, in videos the
images come in a seamless fashion and their correlation through time can be
exploited to increase the performances.

The main problem of this task is that if labeling images for semantic
segmentation is expensive, the time required to label all the frames of a
video is even more dramatic. One typical way to alleviate this issue is to
label only a subset of the frames, either by dropping most of the frames and
providing only a few of them with their corresponding mask, or by providing all
the input frames with only a subset of them annotated. Another way to reduce
the labeling effort is to just label the main subject of each frame or to
reduce the number of classes (to the limit case of foreground/background
separation).

Applying machine learning techniques to this class of problems is challenging
due to the lack of large amounts of labeled data, as well as for the huge
amount of time required to train these kind of models that calls for
non-trivial technological solutions. The time spent on operations that are not
strictly related to training, such as loading and preprocessing the data,
saving the weights on disk, saving samples and generating plots to monitor the
progress of the algorithm, has to be minimized. Another recent trend in this
field is to resort to multi-GPU training, that introduces an almost linear
speedup (up to a certain numbers of GPUs)~\cite{theano2016short,ma2016theano}
but increases the complexity of the algorithm, is often subject to constraints
(e.g., the GPUs might have to be hosted by the same machine or node of a
cluster) and makes debugging much less pleasant in many cases.

\autoref{sec:reseg} analyzed ReSeg~\citep{Visin_2016_CVPR_Workshops}, an
RNN-based model for image semantic segmentation. One of the main strengths of
ReSeg comes from the coupling of fast general-purpose CNN feature extractors
with stateful RNNs able to carry the information extracted by the CNNs through
various steps of computation, showing the effectiveness of RNNs applied to the
spatial domain.

% While in ReSeg RNNs are allowed to move over the spatial dimension of the data
% rather than the temporal one.
This approach can be taken a step further by allowing the RNNs to jointly
process space and time information in videos, by placing the CNNs directly into
the inner computation of the recursive layer. This chapter introduces a novel
architecture that aims to address the task separation traditionally enforced by
the CNN-RNN dichotomy jointly processing the temporal and the spatial
information at each level of the recurrent-convolutional hierarchy.


\section{Motivation}

% Intro
In the last years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully
applied to address many computer vision tasks, such as image
classification~\citep{Krizhevsky2012-alexnet,Simonyan2015,
Szegedy-et-al-arxiv2014} and object detection~\citep{Girshick-et-al-arxiv2013,
Sermanet13overfeat} and their application has become ubiquitous in many well
known and widely used commercial products.

More recently, pixel-wise prediction of still images has enjoyed the attention
of the computer vision community. In contrast to image classification and
object detection this \emph{structured prediction} problem requires each
pixel to be classified, which demands for a more fine detail understanding of
the image, as well as consistency in the prediction. In this domain many
state of the art architectures successfully coupled classification models
trained on ImageNet~\citep{Simonyan14vgg,Szegedy15googlelenet} with various
upsampling strategies in a trainable end-to-end fashion to address the
challenging image segmentation and scene parsing task~\citep[see e.g.,~][]{
long2014fully,noh2015learning}.

The success witnessed on still images has rapidly reached the video domain,
achieving remarkable results in tasks such as video action recognition~\citep{
simonyan2014two,karpathy2014large}, event detection in videos~\citep{
yeung2015end} and video captioning~\citep{yao2015describing}. Along this
direction, some effort has been devoted lately to address the more
challenging task of end to end video semantic segmentation~\citep{Tran16v2v}.

While many computer vision video-related tasks involve predicting only a single
or a few outputs per video, some of them -- such as video semantic
segmentation, change detection and object tracking -- require a per
\emph{temporal "voxel"} prediction. As an analogy to 3D voxels, where a
volumetric pixel (or voxel) is used to describe a local portion of the data
that extends across space in three dimensions, temporal voxels refer to 3D
portions of the data that span over a contiguous two-dimensional space and over
a one-dimensional sequence in the temporal domain.
Works in this direction usually define a fixed {\emph a priori} window on the
temporal dimension to obtain a voxel-wise prediction~\citep{Tran16v2v}.

The most common way to address video related tasks with neural network
approaches is to combine CNNs with RNNs in a sequential fashion, by first
applying a (possibly pre-trained) CNN on each frame and then interpreting the
resulting feature maps in a temporal consistent way by processing them with an
RNN~\cite{Donahue-et-al-arxiv2014,Vinyals-et-al-CVPR2015,Karpathy+Li-CVPR2015,
Venugopalan_2015_ICCV}. While this is an effective way to exploit the temporal
information, the two pipelines don't completely benefit from each other, since
the temporal consistency is enforced only in the last step. Furthermore, the
spatial relations are mostly ignored by the state of the RNN as they are taken
into account only through the encoding coming from the CNNs.

On this note, \cite{ShiCWYWW15} propose an interesting approach that deeply
entangles the convolution operator with the state-to-state and input-to-state
transitions of the RNN itself, rather than encoding each frame independently
with CNNs and then processing the spatial encodings timewise with an RNN.

The model presented in this chapter, called Decoder Encoder Convolutional LSTM
(DEConvLSTM), builds on top of~\cite{ShiCWYWW15} and extends their work in two
ways: i) replacing the convolution operator in the state-to-state and
input-to-state transitions with a full multi-layer convolutional subnetwork ii)
introducing a novel recurrent-convolutional-upsampling layer that learns how to
leverage the spatio-temporal dimensions jointly to produce an upsampled feature
map that respects the 2D topology of the input feature map and at the same time
maintains its time consistency.

The full model mimics the conventional 2D semantic segmentation encoder-decoder
architecture, but is able to jointly capture spatio-temporal information, using
the internal memory of RNNs instead of a fixed window of time.

\section{Model description}\label{sec:deconvlstm_model}

Videos can be interpreted as a set of frames that interlace spatial information
through time. The supporting idea of this model builds on this, with the claim
that space and time cannot be processed sequentially -- as done by much of the
past ML literature -- but rather the two should be mixed together in a coherent
and joint architecture. The proposed DEConvLSTM intertwines space with time at
each step of the hierarchy~(see~\autoref{fig:deconvlstm_model}), taking
inspiration from the ConvLSTM model described in~\cite{ShiCWYWW15}.
% and pushing that intuition further.

As many successful models for semantic segmentation on static images, the
DEConvLSTM couples an encoding and a decoding pathway, that respectively shrink
the resolution of the intermediate feature maps, encoding a rich representation
of the input, and upsample it to recover the resolution of the input video.

This section will introduce the novelties of the DEConvLSTM model, starting
with a description of the encoding pathway that builds on the ConvLSTM model
and then building on that to uncover the novelties of the proposed model.

        connections.}\label{fig:deconvlstm_model}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Convolutional LSTM}

In~\cite{ShiCWYWW15} the authors propose a model called convolutional
LSTM~(ConvLSTM) that is a modification of the well-known LSTM with peephole
connections. To allow for a more convenient comparison, the equations of the
vanilla LSTM with peephole connections (that were defined
in~\autoref{eq:LSTM_peepholes}) are reported here

\begin{equation*}\tag{\ref{eq:LSTM_peepholes} revisited}
\begin{split}
    i_t &= \sigma\left(W_i \cdot \left[h_{t-1}, x_t\right] +
        W_{ic} \hadamard C_{t-1} + b_i \right)\\
    f_t &= \sigma\left(W_f \cdot \left[h_{t-1}, x_t\right] +
        W_{fc} \hadamard C_{t-1} + b_f \right)\\
    \tilde C_t &= tanh \left(W_c \cdot \left[h_{t-1}, x_t\right] + b_c \right)\\
    C_t &= f_t \hadamard C_{t-1} + i_t \hadamard \tilde C_t\\
    o_t &= \sigma\left(W_o \cdot \left[h_{t-1}, x_t\right] +
        W_{oc} \hadamard C_{t-1} + b_o \right)\\
    h_t &= o_t \hadamard tanh \left(C_t\right),
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $x_t$ and $h_t$ are the input and output feature maps
respectively at time $t$; $C_t$ is the state of the cell (or memory) of the
recurrent unit at time $t$; $i_t$, $f_t$, $o_t$ are respectively the states of
the input gate, the forget gate and the output gate and control the behavior of
the recurrent unit given the input and its state at each time step $t$;
$\sigma$ is the logistic function, $W_{\star}$ the weights
and $\hadamard$ the Hadamard product. Note that the compact notation
$W_\star * [h_{t-1}, x_t]$ represents $W_{\star h} * h_{t-1} + W_{\star x} *
x_t$.

The convolutional LSTM of~\cite{ShiCWYWW15} replaces the dot products with
convolutions, leading to the following formulation

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    i_t &= \sigma\left(W_i * \left[h_{t-1}, x_t\right] +
        W_{ic} \hadamard C_{t-1} + b_i \right)\\
    f_t &= \sigma\left(W_f * \left[h_{t-1}, x_t\right] +
        W_{fc} \hadamard C_{t-1} + b_f \right)\\
    \tilde C_t &= tanh \left(W_c * \left[h_{t-1}, x_t\right] + b_c \right)\\
    C_t &= f_t \hadamard C_{t-1} + i_t \hadamard \tilde C_t\\
    o_t &= \sigma\left(W_o * \left[h_{t-1}, x_t\right] +
        W_{oc} \hadamard C_{t-1} + b_o \right)\\
    h_t &= o_t \hadamard tanh \left(C_t\right),
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $*$ is the convolution operator. Notably, as opposed to
classical recurrent architectures, all gates and states here have \emph{spatial
dimensions} as they are the result of the application of convolutions on the
input of the layer.

The encoding pathway of the DeconvLSTM model builds from this, with two
modifications: i) it introduces a full, multi-layered, CNN, in place of the
convolution operator; ii) it replaces the Hadamard product with a convolution.
This is expressed in~\autoref{eq:deconvLSTM_enc}
%resulting in the following equations

\begin{equation}\label{eq:deconvLSTM_enc}
\begin{split}
    i_t &= \sigma\left(W_{ix}^{(L)} * \dots * \rho W_{ix}^{(1)} *
        \rho W_{ix}^{(0)} * x_t + W_i * \left[h_{t-1}, C_{t-1}\right] +
        b_i \right)\\
    f_t &= \sigma\left(W_{fx}^{(L)} * \dots * \rho W_{fx}^{(1)} *
        \rho W_{fx}^{(0)} * x_t + W_f * \left[h_{t-1}, C_{t-1}\right] +
        b_f \right)\\
    \tilde C_t &= tanh \left(W_{cx}^{(L)} * \dots * \rho W_{cx}^{(1)} *
        \rho W_{cx}^{(0)} * x_t + W_c * h_{t-1} + b_c \right)\\
    C_t &= f_t \hadamard C_{t-1} + i_t \hadamard \tilde C_t\\
    o_t &= \sigma\left(W_{ox}^{(L)} * \dots * \rho W_{ox}^{(1)} *
        \rho W_{ox}^{(0)} * x_t + W_o * \left[h_{t-1}, C_{t-1}\right] +
        b_o \right)\\
    h_t &= o_t \hadamard tanh \left(C_t\right).
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent A $ReLU$ nonlinearity $\rho$ follows every convolution on the input
$W_{\star x}^{(\star)}$ apart from the last ones $W_{\star x}^{(L)}$, since the
usual $\sigma$ nonlinearity is already applied to the output of the layer to
keep the typical LSTM behavior intact. The last convolutions $W_\star^{(L)}$
are also followed by a pooling layer (not expressed in the equations) to reduce
the dimensionality of the intermediate feature maps before the nonlinearity is
applied.

The substitution of the Hadamard products with convolutions allows to reduce
the number of parameters and is consistent with the idea of retaining the
spatial structure in the internal state and gates of the LSTM. It also allows
the network to process videos with a different resolution than the one it was
trained on, which is often a convenient property.


\subsection{Transposed Convolutional LSTM}

It became common lately to address the problem of segmenting still images
with architectures that first shrink the resolution of the feature maps to
produce a lower-dimensionality yet rich encoding, and then upsample the
intermediate feature maps back to the original image size in order to emit a
per-pixel prediction~(see~\autoref{sec:reseg}). This kind of structure has
proven to be very effective to segment 2D images.

Transferring this knowledge to the video segmentation task, the DEConvLSTM
model introduces a novel Transposed Convolutional LSTM (TransConvLSTM) layer
that exploits transposed convolutions to recover the resolution lost due to the
pooling layers. In the same fashion as for the ConvLSTM layer, the
TransConvLSTM layer inserts a transposed CNN~\emph{inside} the state update
function of an LSTM with peephole connections

\begin{equation}\label{eq:deconvLSTM_dec}
\begin{split}
    i_t &= \sigma\left(W_{ix}^{(L)} \circledast \dots \circledast
        \rho W_{ix}^{(1)} \circledast \rho W_{ix}^{(0)} \circledast x_t +
        W_i * \left[h_{t-1}, C_{t-1}\right] + b_i \right)\\
    f_t &= \sigma\left(W_{fx}^{(L)} \circledast \dots \circledast
        \rho W_{fx}^{(1)} \circledast \rho W_{fx}^{(0)} \circledast x_t +
        W_f * \left[h_{t-1}, C_{t-1}\right] + b_f \right)\\
    \tilde C_t &= tanh \left(W_{cx}^{(L)} \circledast \dots \circledast
        \rho W_{cx}^{(1)} \circledast \rho W_{cx}^{(0)} \circledast x_t +
        W_c * h_{t-1} + b_c \right)\\
    C_t &= f_t \hadamard C_{t-1} + i_t \hadamard \tilde C_t\\
    o_t &= \sigma\left(W_{ox}^{(L)} \circledast \dots \circledast
        \rho W_{ox}^{(1)} \circledast \rho W_{ox}^{(0)} \circledast x_t +
        W_o * \left[h_{t-1}, C_{t-1}\right] + b_o \right)\\
    h_t &= o_t \hadamard tanh \left(C_t\right).
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent The TransConvLSTM applies multiple layers of transposed convolutions
($\circledast$) with unit stride and "same" padding, followed by a last
transposed convolution whose stride is a hyperparameter of the model and whose
output shape (when stride $> 1$ multiple output shapes are possible, see the
$a$ parameter in~\autoref{rel:padding_strides_transposed_odd}) is fixed to be
the same as the one of the corresponding ConvLSTM in the encoding pathway.
Finally, as was done for the encoding pathway, every convolution on the input
apart from the last one is followed by a $ReLU$ nonlinearity to keep the
typical LSTM behavior intact.

\subsection{Bidirectional RNNs}
Bidirectional RNNs (Bi-RNNs)~\cite{Schuster1997bidirecrnn} have been
successfully employed in the literature for image and video related
tasks~\cite{Graves+Schmidhuber-2009,visin2015renet,Du2015_CVPR,
Visin_2016_CVPR_Workshops}. Given an input sequence, Bi-RNNs move over it in
both directions at the same time, i.e., from the first element forwards and
from the last element backwards. This allows them to integrate information
coming from previous and following elements at each position of the sequence.
In videos, this ensures a smoother temporal consistency in the predictions. In
contrast with~\cite{ShiCWYWW15}, the DEConvLSTM model exploits bidirectional
LSTMs to enforce temporal coherence in the predictions.

The forward and backward passes can be combined at each time step either via
concatenation over the feature maps axis, as initially suggested in~\cite{
Schuster1997bidirecrnn}, or by summing them elementwise. Both alternatives have
been explored in the early exploratory experiments for the DEConvLSTM model,
including a variant of the sum that rather than performing an arithmetic mean
learns the parameters of a weighted sum

\begin{equation}
    RNN_t^{\leftrightarrow} = \alpha_t RNN_t^{\leftarrow} +
        (1 - \alpha_t) RNN_t^{\rightarrow}, \quad\text{for $t$ in sequence}
\end{equation}

\noindent and an alternative variant with the same parameter $\alpha$ shared
across all the time steps. Concatenation seems to give slightly better
performances and has therefore been selected as combination method for the
rest of the experiments. However, as a future work, it could be interesting to
assess whether the accuracy gain justifies the higher memory consumption.
% Due to memory constraints, we don't follow the trend of concatenating the B-RNN
% outputs \cite{}, but rather sum them


\subsection{Skip Connections}
One very popular component of many recent ANN-based architectures are skip
connections~\citep[see e.g.,~][]{sermanet-cvpr-13,liu2015parsenet,
long2015fully,Srivastava-et-al-arxiv2015,bell2015inside,he2015deep,
hariharan2015hypercolumns}, which add a connection between earlier layers in
the hierarchy and downstream layer~\emph{skipping} the intermediate ones. This
has been proven to improve the performance of many tasks, especially when
high resolution spatial information is needed in the last stages. When it comes
to images and videos semantic segmentation this is a crucial element to recover
detailed informations on where the objects are, which improves the upsampling
precision of the decoding pathway.

The DEConvLSTM model follows this well-established practice as well. The
TransConvLSTM layers are parametrized so that they emit a feature map of the
same resolution as the corresponding encoding layer~(see~\autoref{%
fig:deconvlstm_model}). The skip connections reflect this shape pattern linking
the encoding layers to the decoding layers with the same resolution.


\section{Experiments}\label{sec:deconvLSTM_experiments}
% \subsection{FCN8}
% FCN8 network achieved state of the art results on semantic segmentation tasks
% \cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/LongSD15}. The FCN8 network is divided into two parts : a
% contracting part and a decontracting part, so that the output of the network
% has the same size than the input. The contracting part is adapted from vgg
% \cite{Simonyan14vgg}. The decontracting part is made of 3 transposed
% convolutions, to what paper meaning, add citation, which output a slighty
% larger map than the input. A crop layer then reshape the output to the exact
% same size of the input. Two skip connections are added between layers in the
% contracting path and the corresponding one in decontracting path.
%
% We reused the weights of the contrating path without retraining them. However,
% we retrain all the decontracting path when used.
%
% This FCN8 network is used a baseline in 3 configurations :
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item As is. No modification to the network is done. Only the decontracting
%         path is trained. The network has no temporality taken into account.
%     \item We add a convolutional LSTM layer on top of the network. The time is
%         taken into account only at the top scale.
%     \item The transposed convolutions of the decontracting path are replaced by
%         upsampling LSTM layers. The temporality is taken into account at
%         different scales in the decontracting path. Like in the previous point
%         convolutional LSTM layer is added on top. The skip connections of the
%         original FCN8 are removed.

\subsection{Experimental settings}\label{sec:deconvLSTM_settings}
In this section, we study the effectiveness of involving the temporal
information on the task of video spatial segmentaion. Our experiments with
regarding to our pipeline are designed to find an optimum way of involving the
temporal information.
Toward this end, we compare our end to end segmentation method with two
following baselines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Segmentation over each frame independently using Convnet. In this
        case, we don't involve any temporal information.
    \item Employing the temporal information only on half of the network. (TODO:
        why are we using this as a baseline?)
\end{itemize}
As explained earlier we employ the temporal information on every layers of the
network and have a recursion over time at each layer. Therefore, we have both
convolutional LSTM and upsampling LSTM. (TODO: requires more explanation)
\subsubsection{Configuration of the layers}
The convolutional and upsampling layers respectively consist of 70 and 100
units. We apply batch normalization on each scale.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:deconvLSTM_conclusions}
